# festival_organizer
This is a useful python script that looks into your music preferences and helps to create an agenda based on your music preferences.

To run the application currently you need to go get a key from spotify's website for their api.
Once you have the key linked, you can then enter in the account of the spotify user you want to scrape the playlist from.

Run the requirements.txt file to download the correct packages for python.
